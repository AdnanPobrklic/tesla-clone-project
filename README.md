# Welcome to the Tesla website clone! This website was created using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a replica of the official Tesla website. Below you will find some important information about this project.

Folder structure:

    index.html: This is the main HTML file for the website.
    img: This folder contains all the images and icons used on the website.
    css: This folder contains all the CSS styles used to style the website.
    js: This folder contains all the JavaScript code used to add functionality to the website.

## HTML:
The HTML structure closely follows the original Tesla website. The navigation bar, header, and main content sections have been replicated as closely as possible. The website is fully responsive and can be viewed on desktops, laptops and mobile devices.

## CSS:
The website has been styled using CSS to match the original Tesla website as closely as possible. The fonts, colors, and layout have been carefully chosen to provide a similar user experience. The website is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and resolutions.

## JavaScript:
The website features some simple JavaScript code to add some interactivity to the website. The navigation bar and mobile menu have been implemented using JavaScript to provide a smooth user experience. The website is fully functional without JavaScript, but these features provide an enhanced experience.
